    I moved here from Africa at a young age, and was raised with 3 siblings.
    <br>
    <br>
    I've always liked the idea of helping people and I have a great
    <br>
    <br>
    amount of experience with kids due to
    babysitting my younger siblings and cousins.
    <br>
    <br>
    My goal is to be successful in the STEM field, specifically in the medical field.
    <br>
    <br>
    I signed up for the Brooklyn STEAM center in hopes of gaining
    <br>
    <br>
     opportunities and Internships to help me achieve
    those goals.
    <br>
    <br>
    I love to play basketball and enjoy watching anime on my free time.
