      <br>
      My name is Khadidiatou Djibril.
      <br>
      <br>
      I am a hardworking student athlete attending Benjamin Banneker Academy in New York City.
      <br>
      <br>
      I moved here from Africa at a young age, and was raised with 3 siblings.
      <br>
      <br>
      I've always liked the idea of helping people and I have a great
      <br>
      <br>
      amount of experience with kids due to
      babysitting my younger siblings and cousins.
      <br>
      <br>
      My goal is to be successful in the STEM field, specifically in the medical field.
      <br>
      <br>
      I signed up for the Brooklyn STEAM center in hopes of gaining
      <br>
      <br>
       opportunities and Internships to help me achieve
      those goals.
