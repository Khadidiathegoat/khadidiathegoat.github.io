 My name is Khadidiatou Djibril . I am a hardworking student athlete attending Benjamin Banneker Academy in New York City. I moved here from Africa at a young age, and was raised with 3 siblings. I've always liked the idea of helping people and I have a great amount of experience with kids due to babysitting my younger siblings and cousins. 
My goal is to be successful in the STEM field, specifically in the medical field. I signed up for the Brooklyn STEAM center in hopes of gaining opportunities and Internships to help me achieve those goals.
